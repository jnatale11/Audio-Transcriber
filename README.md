# Audio-Transcriber
This project brings state of the art speech-to-text technology to the browser. All WAV files which are RIFF formatted can be uploaded to the web page, starting a process of slicing and dynamic WebSocket creation. Each stream sends 5 minutes of audio for processing, parses the JSON result, and outputs back to the browser.
